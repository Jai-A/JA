    <h1>Soil Analysis &nbsp;</h1>
    <p>In order to ensure the best possible results, we recommend our clients have their siteâ€™s soil analysed prior to commencing
        revegetation works. This is especially valuable for sites with imported soil or heavily disturbed sites, such as
        mine sites, or where soil has been left bare for extensive periods of time.</p>
    <p>Lanyonscapes provides services for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Soil sampling</li>
        <li>Analysis</li>
        <li>Recommendations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our qualified staff conduct soil sampling (or can assist your staff in taking samples) and send these samples to a NATA-accredited
        lab for analysis. With these results, we consult with our fully-qualified Soil Scientist to develop a Soil Report
        detailing amelioration agents or other products that could be used to create optimal growing conditions within the
        soil.</p>
    <p>These results can also be used to tailor
        <a href="/managementPlans/">plant or seed recommendations</a> for your site.</p>
