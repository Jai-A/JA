    <h1>DIRECT SEEDING &nbsp;</h1>
    <p>Lanyonscapes offers grass, tree and/or shrub seeding for all disturbed areas associated&nbsp;with mining or construction.
        Direct seeding involves distributing seed and fertiliser&nbsp;without large quantities of additional materials such
        as mulch.</p>
    <p>Direct seeding is designed for broad scale revegetation. It is an excellent way to revegetate your property quickly and
        efficiently using seed.</p>
    <p>Site preparation is very important for all direct seeding jobs, and Lanyonscapes can advise on preparation,

    <h2>Delivery</h2>
    <p>Seed can be located under the soil surface or on top of the soil, depending on species selection and soil type.&nbsp;The
        method of seeding is determined by factors such as terrain and accessibility, size of the job, quality of site preparation,
        and safety considerations.</p>
    <p>Lanyonscapes delivers most direct seeding by tractor, using various attachments, or by hydroseeding.&nbsp;Lanyonscapesâ€™
        hydro seeders are the largest available on the market. Hydroseeding medium usually contains mulch and tackifier to
        bind seed to soil and prevent wind loss.</p>
