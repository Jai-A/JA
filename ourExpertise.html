            <h3>Tailored delivery</h3>
            <p>A revegetation project is only as successful as the soil media supplied. We manage the rejuvenation of any type
                of planting media using scientific analysis and reports. Our subsequent application of highly effective soil
                amelioration products are perfectly tailored to your soil media for good predicted growth.</p>
            <p>We design our mixes when hydromulching and hydroseeding to suit your soil type and your budget constraints. Some
                projects require additional soil protection such as installation of
                <a href="/erosionControlBlankets/"
                    target="_blank">erosion control blankets</a> or jute matting. Lanyonscapes can fulfill your project objectives from beginning
                to end. Or we can slot into your project wherever our expertise is needed.</p>
