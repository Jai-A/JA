    <h2>How Hot Pods® Work</h2>
    <p>Hot Pods are applied via specialised spreading equipment that allows a precise rate of application over typical terrains
        up to 4:1 slopes. Precision ensures even coverage and economical application. Aerial applications via helicopter
        or plane can be used in areas that were previously inaccessible using standard revegetation techniques.</p>
    <p>Once spread, the Hot Pods® start improving the immediate area by releasing the microbial activators, soil conditioners
        and trace elements to generate growth zones. They will remain intact until rain melts the pods and all ingredients
        are released. Seeds germinate in the growing media inside the pod and send roots into the soil which is already been
        improved. Growth will continue as the pods incorporate themselves into the soil with each rain event.</p>
