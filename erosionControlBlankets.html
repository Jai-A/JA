    <h2>Jute Matting</h2>
    <p>Jute Matting is an organic geotextile which aids in weed and erosion control. An environmentally friendly way of protecting
        young trees and shrubs by reducing competing weeds and the need to use damaging herbicide.</p>
    <p>Because the Jute Matting allows both air and water to pass unimpeded through its construction, the soil beneath it can
        breath, promoting growth of desired plants while reducing evaporation and minimising watering needs.</p>
    <p>The heavier grades of Jute Mat are also used as weed suppressants while the lighter grades of Jute Mat provides an ideal
        media for seed germination as it protects the soil from erosion while still allowing the seed to grow through the
        matting.</p>

    <p>Jute Matting is the simplest, safest, and most cost effective method of promoting new growth on the worst affected slopes
        because it enhances water filtration whilst protecting precious topsoils.</p>

    <h2>Cior Netting</h2>
    <p>Coir Mesh is a natural fibre matting made from 100% natural coconut fibre that is spun and woven into a matting available
        in various grades. Coir Mesh is an open weave geotextile that is fully biodegradable adding organic matter to the
        soil. As coir is an abundant and renewable resource, there is a range of environmentally friendly products that are
        widely used in civil engineering and for land and slope stabilisation applications. When vegetated, it has the mechanical
        strength necessary to hold soil in place and prevent erosion. The coir netting breaks up runoff from heavy rains
        and dissipates the energy of flowing water&nbsp;and wind. Coir Mesh also promotes the growth of new vegetation by
        absorbing water and preventing the topsoil from drying out.</p>
    <p>Coir Mesh has double the life of jute and higher tensile strength than other organic geotextiles with a longevity of
        around five years. This allows ample time for natural vegetation to establish and therefore stabilise the area.</p>
    <p>Coir Mesh is ideally suited for preventing and controlling erosion even on steep slopes. When installed according to
        our recommendations and planted into or seeded, Coir Mesh will not only stabilise the area but also retain moisture
        and assist seed germination.</p>

    <h2>Enkamat</h2>
    <p>Enkamat is a flexible three-dimensional mat for immediate, permanent erosion protection on the most varied slope types.
        The open Enkamat product types are particularly suitable for use on steep dry slopes exposed to wind and rain and
        hence prone to erosion. Open Enkamat’s artificial root structure with up to 1,800 m filament per m² creates an artificial
        root structure preventing soil eroding from steep slopes, river banks, landfill containments and other vulnerable
        areas.</p>
    <p>As a general rule, once laid on slopes, Enkamat is seeded and filled with humus or fertile soil. Vegetation can then
        take root and develop easily, because of Enkamat’s artificial root structure protecting the soil and germinating
        seed.</p>
    <p>It is designed to help nature develop strong vegetation for permanent erosion protection of slopes, rivers, banks, ditches,
        channels, spillways, landfills, shorelines and other vulnerable erosion-prone areas.</p>
