    <p>Planting Media Management Plans document the inspections, checks and protocols Lanyonscapes follow before applying hydromulch
        or hydroseed. This plan ensures your project’s plant media is of the correct quality and adequately prepared.</p>
    <p>The document explains the identification and decision-making process to assess the soil and specifies how the soil is
        to be treated and prepared prior to hydromulch and hydroseed application.</p>
    <p>It’s recommended that
        <a href="/soilAnalysis/">soil testing</a> be conducted prior to the preparation of the plan to ensure optimal results.</p>
