        <span style="color: #000000;">HCOB is ideal for use on difficult terrains, like embankments and batters, to achieve revegetation goals. Often steep
            embankments don’t have much existing topsoil (or any at all) so it can be difficult for seeds to germinate. HCOB
            offers an all-in-one solution to this problem by combining compost with the traditional&nbsp;</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Compost is the ideal medium to support plant growth, especially on poor soils.HCOB is applied in a similar manner
            to hydromulch – ingredients are added to the tank and mixed to create a slurry of revegetation goodness; it’s
            then carefully sprayed out across the site to ensure consistent coverage. When applied, it looks like this:</span>
