<div style="background-color: #ffffff;">
    <p>In May 2016, Lanyonscapes was contracted to stabilize a stockpile on Curtis Island, QLD, with tube stock and jute matting.
        In total, we planted 2,900 native seedlings across the stockpile. Plants included a mix of grasses, like
        <em>Themanda triandra</em>, as well as trees like&nbsp;
        <em>Acacia falcata. </em>All plants were selected based on suitability to the area.</p>

    <p>In order to give the plants the best chance of survival, we also installed temporary irrigation. As with all our works,
        we recommend frequent watering to improve results.</p>
