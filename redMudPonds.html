        <strong>Area: 60 Ha
            <br> Client: Rio Tinto Alcan
            <br> Services: Soil amelioration and stabilisation</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Lanyonscapes mobilised equipment and products to the remote community of Gove to deliver soil amendments and stabilisation
        to the capping of old red mud dams and to batters of new red mud ponds.</p>
    <p>Application quantities and quality were a high priority to ensure the freshly prepared batters were covered as they became
        available to minimise the impact of rain squalls and reduce the costs of reworking.</p>
    <p>The crew worked with the earthworks contractors to achieve this and subsequently return several years later for continued
        work on the expansion program and for the plant decommissioning stage.</p>
