        <a href="/flexterra/" target="_blank">Flexterra</a>® is an alternative to hydromulch for high risk sites or areas where water availability is limited.It’s
        applied in a similar manner to hydromulch but instead, cane mulch is substituted for the Flexterra fibre.</p>
    <p>We used Flexterra on a site near Gladstone in December 2015. The site typically has poor soil conditions and no resources
        available for irrigation.</p>
    <p>These photos were taken in January 2016. A good rainfall over Christmas really helped get things get started!</p>
