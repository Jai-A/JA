    <h1>HAYMULCHING &nbsp;</h1>
    <p>Haymulching is similar to hydromulching except that the mulch is applied dry. Seed and fertiliser are applied first by
        direct seeding and a blanket of hay is applied over the seed.

    </p>
    <p>Haymulching machines are either pulled behind a truck or tractor and bails of hay are fed into the machine. Consecutively, 
        this machine is a chopper and blower and delivers a uniform layer of hay that can be help in place by a tackifier to minimise wind loss
    </p>
    <p>An advantage of haymulching/strawblowing is the fact that site-based grass with seed heads can be slashed and bailed and distributed to the 
        adjacent rehabilitation area thereby spreading the collected seed evenly with the mulch</p>
    <h2>Key considerations</h2>
    <p>There is a variety of considerations when selecting the most effective product for your projects. Contact Lanyonscapes
        early in your planning so we can provide expert advice on the best options for your project.</p>
    <p>Key considerations for the use of haymulching/strawblowing are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>does not offer the same erosion protection as hydromulching, in most situations</li>
        <li>requires less water than hydromulching</li>
        <li>discharge distance from the blower is less than achievable with hydromulching.</li>
    </ul>
