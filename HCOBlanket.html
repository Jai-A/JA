    <h1>HYDRO COMPOST ORGANICS BLANKET &nbsp;</h1>
    <p>The Hydro Compost Organics Blanket (HCOB) is the result of Lanyonscapes R&amp;D determination to offer a product that
        delivers outstanding results in tough Australian conditions.</p>
    <p>It has delivered excellent results throughout Queensland on Main Roads projects, heavy industrial areas and residential
        developments.</p>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Topsoil replacement on steep batters, both cut and fill</li>
        <li>Alternative to pneumatic compost blankets and organics blankets</li>
        <li>Adaptable to suit all erosion control applications</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="text-align: left;">Description</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style="text-align: left;">Fully biodegradable growth media, soil stabilizer and conditioner</li>
        <li style="text-align: left;">Contains natural plant and soil bio stimulants</li>
        <li style="text-align: left;">Contains specialist formulated amelioration agents to amend subsoil and promote growth – tailored to each job using
            <a href="/soilAnalysis/" target="_blank">soil science</a>
        </li>
        <li style="text-align: left;">Free from weed seed&nbsp;and&nbsp;foreign objects</li>
        <li style="text-align: left;">Requires no curing period</li>
        <li style="text-align: left;">Forms intimate bond with soil surface to create erosion resistant blanket</li>
        <li style="text-align: left;">Allows for rapid germination and accelerated plant growth</li>
        <li style="text-align: left;">Applied at 48.5 tonnes per hectare, provides a growth medium layer of 25mm and further soil bond and amelioration
            of up to 50mm deep.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <p>HCOB is a high performance, flexible growth medium with many benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Offers soil science, knowledge-based, bio stimulants to optimise growth;</li>
        <li>Can be engineered for specific site soil conditions, delivering optimum results;</li>
        <li>Incorporates both erosion control and revegetation components;</li>
        <li>Soil ameliorants can be incorporated into the mix;</li>
        <li>Hydraulic application adds moisture to the soil profile and incorporates the soil into its bonded matrix;</li>
        <li>Bonding enhances the overall profile and reduces moisture loss through evaporation;</li>
        <li>Does not require immediate and diligent watering to achieve stability through vegetative cover;</li>
        <li>Remains a dormant cover until conditions are ideal for seed germination;</li>
        <li>Has comparable sheer strength to imported
            <a href="/flexterra/" target="_blank">wood fibre products</a> – at a lower price;</li>
        <li>Contains “Active8”, an industry recognised compost and soil conditioning product (Australian standard AS4454);</li>
        <li>Contains the organic fibres of cane and paper, included as per best practice hydromulching guidelines (MRTS16C and
            L230);</li>
        <li>Product efficiencies include reduced plant and equipment mobilisation costs, pallet delivery means no need for bulk
            stockpiles;</li>
        <li>Application via manned cannon eliminates the need for personnel working on batters or from cherry pickers;</li>
        <li>Highly manoeuvrable trucks use existing site access and road ways.</li>
    </ul>
