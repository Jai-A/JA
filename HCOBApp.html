<div style="background-color:#ffffff">
    In early 2015, Lanyonscapes was contracted to vegetate a sheer batter face, north-west of Gladstone, QLD. Due to the challenging
    nature of the site and a lack of existing topsoil,
    <a href="/HCOBlanket/">Hydro Compost Organics Blanket</a> (HCOB) was proposed for use as it would provide a growing medium (compost) for the
    grass while also preventing further erosion of the area.
    <p></p>
    <p>A trial area was set aside to determine if HCOB would be an effective treatment option.</p>
    <p>The site was irrigated to aid grass growth.</p>
    <p>The site was sprayed in January 2015.</p>
