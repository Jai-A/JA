    <h1>HYDROMULCHING &nbsp;</h1>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Hydromulching is a method of revegetation where the seed and fertiliser is mixed in a slurry of organic matter and tackifiers,
        and sprayed onto a prepared surface.</p>
    <p>The blend can contain:

            alt="" width="378" height="283" align="right">
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>grass or tree and shrub species, or a combination of both</li>
        <li>a species selection
            <a href="/managementPlans/" target="_blank">tailored to client requirements</a>, soil type, climate, and other factors</li>
        <li>turf species, for establishing turf quality grass cost effectively.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Lanyonscapes has used hydromulch effectively on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>road and rail batters</li>
        <li>dam walls</li>
        <li>sub-divisions</li>
        <li>
            <a href="/blackwaterCreek/" target="_blank">mine site </a>and quarry rehabilitation</li>
        <li>large open drains</li>
        <li>parks and sporting fields.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <p>Hydromulching offers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>erosion protection and dust suppression</li>
        <li>increased organic content for poor soils</li>
        <li>moisture retention benefits</li>
        <li>a protective blanket for seeds in harsh conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2></h2>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>The hydromulch is applied by powerful truck-mounted pumps capable of a discharge distance up to 40m on level ground or
        further on slopes. Hydromulch offers a solution for coverage of areas that are inaccessible by conventional equipment.
        The slurry is pumped through lay-flat hoses over distances of up to 60 metres from the truck.</p>
    <p>Application rates vary&nbsp; depending on factors such as the degree of erosion protection required.&nbsp; Hydromulch
        can include additives such as bio-stimulants, fertilisers and trace elements. Sometimes
        <a href="/soilAnalysis/"
            target="_blank">soil testing</a> is required to determine exactly what will be required in the hydromulch blend.</p>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p>Choosing the appropriate method, delivery and additives is key to a successful project. Lanyonscapes can provide expert
        advice on matters such as site preparation,
        <a href="/soilAnalysis/" target="_blank">soil samples</a>, recommended application rates, species selection, and maintenance requirements. We recommend that
        you contact us in the early stages of your project so that costly mistakes can be avoided.</p>
